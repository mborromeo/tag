h2. TAG

p. :)

p. We want to create the easiest possible way to allow people to put their projects and experiences online.

p. We think that this can be achieved via a very simple format that tracks project ancestry and external links to pics, code, etc.
We are tired of endless camps and meetings where people talk tak, but never do. Our code is going to support the Hackup format of TAG - _temporary action groups_. People gather, do a project for 4 hours, publish it and then disband. Other people in future meetings can form a new TAG and expand the project.

p. When you want to extend an existing project you just clone it and put your own stuff in there.

p. No login needed, wikistyle.

p. Descriptions, members and links are textile text.
